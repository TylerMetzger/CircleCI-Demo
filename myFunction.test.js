// Jest includes a test() function which takes in a string for the name of the function and a callback function to execute
// A callback function is one that you pass into a function as a parameter which will call it once it runs
// Think of it as calling test is an event, and this event will trigger the callback function to run
// In this case our functions are known as anonymous which just means that they're not named and are defined within the parameter space itself
// () => {...} is usually the formatting for anonymous functions using the ES6 syntax
